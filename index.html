                <h3>Latest Experience</h3>
                <h4>HyperionDev Software Engineering Bootcamp</h4>
                <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 16 weeks</p>
                <p>
                    Hyperion Dev, in partnership with the Department for Education, offered a highly coveted software engineering bootcamp for aspiring software engineers. With over 20,000 applicants vying for a spot, only 1500 were selected to participate in this intensive program.<br>
                    The bootcamp covers a wide range of relevant topics, including Python, Django, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, SQL, read documentations, and industry-standard tools and technologies. With expert instructors and hands-on experience, this program provided me with the necessary skills and knowledge to start my success in software engineering.<br><br>
                    The following projects are the ones I have invested the most time and poured my heart and soul into, and they are in continuous improvement:
                </p>
            </div>
            
            <div>
                <h4><a href="https://github.com/cilippofilia/Inventory.py" target="_blank">Inventory.py</a></h4>
                    <p>
                        This command-line project is designed to assist with the management of a store's inventory. The application is written entirely in Python, utilizing the language's powerful features to create a robust and reliable tool for store owners and managers.<br>
                        By leveraging OOP, this program allows for a high level of flexibility and customization, making it easy to add new items to the inventory or modify existing ones.
                    </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h4><a href="https://github.com/cilippofilia/TaskManager.py" target="_blank">TaskManager.py</a></h4>
                    <p>
                        This command-line interface application is specifically designed to simplify task management. Its OOP design ensures that tasks can be represented accurately and efficiently, allowing users to add, modify, mark complete, see due date or delete tasks, with ease.<br>
                        Object-Oriented Programming also promotes code organization and enhances the program's readability, making it easier to understand and maintain. By encapsulating data and functionality within objects, the program is more robust, less prone to errors, and developers can create specialized versions of objects, further increasing the program's flexibility.
                    </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4><a href="./html/shoes_store.html" target="_blank">Online Sneaker Store</a></h4>
                    <p>
                        The website for this store was designed using Bootstrap, a powerful front-end development framework that allows for the creation of responsive, mobile-first websites.<br>
                        With Bootstrap, a site looks great on any device, from desktop computers to smartphones and tablets. The framework provided a range of pre-designed UI components and utilities that helped to streamline the development process and create a consistent user experience across the site.<br>
                        Thanks to Bootstrap, the website for this online sneaker store is user-friendly, easy to navigate, and visually appealing.
                    </p>

                            The face, core, and foundation of the entire app are developed and shipped entirely using SwiftUI. The app is tailored to perfection for every iPhone to achieve the best user experience possible and native look and feel.<br>
                            To accomplish this, I have implemented the following frameworks:
                            <ul>
                                <li>CloudKit: Used for storing user settings and share it across multiple devices, like preferred settings and language</li>
                                <li>Combine: To handle asyc events in case of in-app purchases</li>
                                <li>CoreData: Used to keep track and store the items created by the user inside the 'Cabinet' section</li>
                                <li>MessageUI: Used to recive feedback and bugs directly from the testers, and users, without leaving the app</li>
                                <li>StoreKit: To support in-app purchases mainly used to learn how to implement and use the framework it in the app</li>
                                <li>Figma: Main tool to sketch, design, wireframe and style app icons, logos, AppStore Connect previews</li>
                                <li>GitHub: Used to work on updates and future release of the app</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                </div>

                            The core and fundation of the whole app are developed and shipped entirly using SwiftUI. The whole app is taylored to perfection for every iPhone and in order to achive the best user experience possible, and that navite look and feel, I have implemented the following frameworks:<br>

                                <li>Combine: Used to handle asynchronous data and check if the purchase of the full app is still valid</li>
                                <li>CoreData: Used to keep track of the data the users add and share it across multiple devices with CloudKit</li>
                                <li>CoreSpotlight: Used to make the search of your projects and tasks from Spotlight and Safari</li>
                                <li>XCTests: Used to test performance, check if all the conditions are satisfied during code execution and validate user interaction flow</li>
                                <li>Figma: Main tool to sketch and design the logo</li>
                                <li>GitHub: Used to keep track of the updates of the app, new implementations and future app release versions</li>
